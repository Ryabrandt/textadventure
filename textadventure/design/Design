Structure Idea from:
http://www.daniweb.com/software-development/python/threads/55140

The structure of the rooms:
[Pre Room]  [4c]
[1a][2a][3a][4a][5a][6a]
[1b][2b][3b][4b][5b]
                [5d][6d]
                    [end]

Entrances, Exits, Hallways...
"go" direction
1a - south, east
1b - north
2a - west, south
2b - north, east
3a - south, east
3b - west, north, east
4a - north, south, east, west
4b - north, east, west
4c - south
5a - south, east, west
5b - north, south, west
5d - north, east
6a - west
6d - (comes from west, cannot turn around)


I created a text adventure. The hardest part of this was figuring out
the best way to move from room to room and have actions that were input by
the user. The story had to be detailed and well written, but still functional and
playable.

I have three modules for the different rooms. Each room is a function. There is
a module for game options, like the die rolls, and then a module for character
information and creation. This module also contains the functions for creating
enemies.

I tried to create a UI and display the text to it, but I never got it to
work the way I wanted it to. I included the UI in the package because I
designed it myself and, in the future, hope to integrate that into the game.
